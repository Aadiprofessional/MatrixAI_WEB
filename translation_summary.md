# Translation Extraction and Merge Summary

## Overview
Successfully extracted and merged translations from Excel file into the existing i18n translation files.

## Files Processed

### Source Files
- **t.xlsx**: Excel file containing translations across multiple sheets
- **extracted_translations.json**: Intermediate file with extracted translations

### Target Translation Files
- **public/locales/en/translation.json**: English translations
- **public/locales/zh-CN/translation.json**: Simplified Chinese translations  
- **public/locales/zh-TW/translation.json**: Traditional Chinese translations

## Results

### Extraction Results
- **15 sheets** processed from Excel file
- **405 total translations** extracted
- Translations organized by sheet with English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese versions

### Merge Results
- **English (en)**: 378 new translations added
- **Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)**: 403 new translations added
- **Traditional Chinese (zh-TW)**: 403 new translations added

## File Structure
Extracted translations are organized under section keys like:
- `extracted_sheet1`
- `extracted_sheet2`
- `extracted_sheet3`
- ... etc.

Each section contains the translated content with safe keys generated from the English text.

## Scripts Created

### 1. read_excel.py
- Extracts translations from Excel file (t.xlsx)
- Handles shared strings and inline values
- Outputs to extracted_translations.json

### 2. merge_translations.py
- Merges extracted translations into existing translation files
- Creates safe keys from English text
- Organizes content under extracted_sheet sections
- Preserves existing translations

## Usage

### To extract translations from a new Excel file:
```bash
python3 read_excel.py
```

### To merge extracted translations:
```bash
python3 merge_translations.py
```

### To update React components to use react-i18next:
```bash
./update-i18n.sh
```

## i18n Configuration
The project uses react-i18next with:
- Language detection
- HTTP backend for loading translation files
- Support for English, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese
- Fallback to English if language not available

## Translation File Locations
- English: `/public/locales/en/translation.json`
- Simplified Chinese: `/public/locales/zh-CN/translation.json`
- Traditional Chinese: `/public/locales/zh-TW/translation.json`

## Notes
- All translations are UTF-8 encoded
- JSON files are formatted with 2-space indentation
- Safe keys are generated by removing special characters and limiting length
- Existing translations are preserved during merge
- New translations are added under organized section keys

## Next Steps
1. Review merged translations for accuracy
2. Test the application with new translations
3. Update any hardcoded strings to use translation keys
4. Consider adding more languages if needed
